                            <p1>Improving accessibility and affordability of healthcare is key to achieving better health outcomes. For patients with Osteoarthritis of the Knee, ongoing engagement with healthcare providers is critical. Tele-physiotherapy can help address physical and logistical barriers by allowing patients to exercise from the comfort of their own homes, while also facilitating more meaningful conversations with their healthcare providers. Through the POAKme mobile app, patients can access rehabilitation exercises on their smartphones and use the on-body motion sensor POAKY to track, record, and analyze their exercise performance in real-time. This data is presented in a graphical format that helps patients visualize their recovery and long-term trends, providing additional motivation to stay on track. Overall, tele-physiotherapy with POAKme has the potential to greatly improve the management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee and enhance patient outcomes.</p1>

                <p1>POAKme is a service that uses a device on the foot to track motion during exercise, and relay the information to the mobile app for real time feedback regarding performance.

                <p-h2>Conclusion</p-h2>
                <p1>Telerehabilitation is a field with potential for massive disruption in rehabilitative medical care. This project aimed at minimising clinical contact while maximising remotely supervised home care. This is extremely important in areas that have poor access to quality care. In light of the Covid pandemic, interventions that can provide care remotely, similar to those received at the clinic, have become important even to those in urban centres. With the mobile and Internet infrastructure only improving from here on, the potential and need for such solutions in the market will grow.</p1>

                <p-h2>My takeaways</p-h2>
                <p1>There’s a lot to physiotherapy that wasn’t incorporated here, such as hold time, or static exercises which can’t be measured. I did not keep accessibility or elderly citizens in mind when designing either. But this leaves scope to explore the solution further for these populations.</p1>
                <p1>Personally, there was a lot of growth in this project. This was the first time I had developed an app, handed it over to someone else along with a device and just seen it work.</p1>
