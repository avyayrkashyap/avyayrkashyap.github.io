        <p2>Introduction</p2>
        <p>In India, accessible and affordable healthcare are fundamental to ensure an ever increasing population remains healthy. Maintenance of quality of life is of vital as one ages. This cannot be more true, especially when dealing with chronic diseases such as Osteoarthritis of the Knee. Rehabilitation through physiotherapy is a treatment method that can help elevate the quality of life with minimal risk to the affected individuals.</p>
        <p>One of the most common methods of managing the symptoms is through physiotherapy. But there are many barriers to appropriating physiotherapy in oneâ€™s life, such as lack of motivation to follow through with an exercise regime, time spent travelling, high costs, necessity to adjust of schedules, ability to follow a complex routines, availability of physiotherapist, or even lack of awareness of the need for physiotherapy.</p>
        <p>Also, physiotherapy of OA Knee requires repeated completion of mundane exercises, diligently, to perceive any observable improvement in daily functioning. Reduced motivation leads to a lack of adherence to physiotherapy regimes, especially in cases of Home Programs.</p>
