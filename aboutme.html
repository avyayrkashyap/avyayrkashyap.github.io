        <p>
            I am currently pursuing a masters in Interaction Design from IDC School of Design, IIT Bombay. Having previously completed four years at IDC as a part of my bachelors, I chose to futher explore the field of design and human computer interactions in an academic atmosphere, by choosing to convert to a Dual Degree.

        With 5G networking on the horizon, I find the possibilites offered by interconnected devices and data to enrich people's lives to be fascinating. As a designer, entering the industry with this backdrop, I find the potential afforded by such technical advancements immensely exciting. I love tinkering with hardware and figuring out ways to harmoniously match it with a seamless software experience.
        </p>
        <p>My interest areas lie in the field of Health-tech medical devices, Tangible interactions, and screenless interfaces. I am the kind of person who prefers doing and showing, as is needed when eliciting interactions with new media devices. The devil is in the details, and my goal is to find the devil. Designing microinteractions, a subject I am extremely passionate about, and after four and a half years of Design School, is now a way of life.</p>
            <p>Oh! And did I mention I am an avid fan of Formula One, Forza Ferrari! I love watching and playing football, and when I get the time, shooting landscapes.</p>
