            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>
                Meal preparation is a complex multisensorial task that requires many decisions to be made based on the appearance of the dish. This alienates individuals with low vision and makes cooking meals independently inaccessible.
                Products designed for individuals with low vision rarely aid with tasks that involve application of heat. As people with vision impairments have different requirements for technology, it is imperative that the behaviours
                and problems faced are thoroughly understood. A study to understand how users perform tasks involving heat application was conducted. Four cooking techniques commonly used to prepare Indian dishes were identified and
                interviews were carried out with a diverse group of visually impaired persons (n=12). The findings include insights about behaviours, problems and strategies employed by visually impaired persons while preparing meals using
                the following techniques: Boiling, Simmering, Roasting, and Frying. This work describes factors that affect behaviour during meal preparation by Indian visually impaired persons, and the various strategies used to mitigate
                challenges faced. The findings have been used to propose a set of considerations that have implications on the design of accessibility tools such as assistive devices, rehabilitation programs and strategies.

                Research Overview
            </h1>

            <h1>Context</h1>
            <p>
                Preparing a meal is a basic activity needed for survival.
                It is a complex multi-sensorial task. Many decisions taken when preparing a meal are dependent on sight.
                Being able to prepare a meal can affect the quality of the life of an individual.
                There is lowered nutrition levels among Visually Impaired Persons (VIPs) due to their reduced ability to shop and prepare meals independently.
            </p>
            <p>
                The body of research dealing with Assistive devices directly related to cooking is slim, with most products considering
                ergonomic needs, but not focusing on the state of the food being prepared. Given this, an extensive Primary research was conducted.
            </p>

            <h1>The Study</h1>

            <h2>Structure</h2>

            <div class="grid-blog">
                <img src="assets/projectimages/ASSETS2020/basicStructure.png" class="blogimage-small" />
                <p1>
                    Two rounds of interviews were conducted. Both the interviews followed a semistructured approach that allowed for a conversation to
                    flow while also developing a rapport with the participant.

                    The first set of interviews was conducted with 7 participants. This was done
                    primarily to gain an understanding of the space to try and weedle out problems from non-problems.

                    A second set of interviews specifically focussing on four commonly used techniques that involve application of
                    heat to prepare dishes was conducted with 5 participants.
                </p1>
            </div>

            <h2>Format</h2>

            <div class="grid-blog">
                <p1>
                    The interviews were conducted as open ended, semi-structured questionnaire, dealing with all the processes involved
                    in meal preparation, from getting the ingredients, preparing the dish, to cleaning the utensils. The second round of
                    interviews focused specifically on four cooking techniques that involved the application of heat: Boiling, Simmering, Roasting and Frying.
                    This was done to allow for the conversation to flow andto develop a rapport with the participant, which enhanced
                    the quality of the discussion and provided fertile groundsfor richer discorvery of problems faced and strategies
                    determined for their mitigation.
                </p1>

            </div>

            <h2>Analysis</h2>

            <div class="grid-blog">
                <img src="assets/projectimages/ASSETS2020/studyanalysis.png" class="blogimage-small" />
                <p1>
                    The conversations were transcribed and the various discussion points were classified into the categories of
                    behaviours, problems faced, and strategies. While behaviours were commonly observed across the group, strategies
                    were specific to the user and their environment, possibly providing a framework for other users to adopt and assimilate as a behaviour.
                </p1>
            </div>

            <h1>Findings</h1>
            <p>
                The findings are categorised into the cooking techniques of boiling, simmering, roasting and frying. A secondary level of categorisation is also done
                using colours. Problems are coded in red, behaviours in blue and strategies in green.
            </p>

            <h2>Boiling</h2>
            <p>
                Boiling is the process of cooking food in boiling water, or other water based liquids such as milk. This generally results in vegetables
                becoming soft and tender, and easy to chew.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h2>Simmering</h2>
            <p>
                Simmering is a process in which foods are cooked in hot liquids just below their boiling temperature. This technique is used to prepare
                most Indian gravies.

            </p>

            <h2>Roasting</h2>
            <p>
                Roasting is a technique that involves cooking food with dry heat with a small amount of cooking oil applied on the pan to prevent the food
                from sticking to it. Foods commonly prepared in this method are rotis, dosas, and processed meats.
            </p>

            <h2>Frying</h2>
            <p>
                Frying is the process of cooking food in oil or any fat. There are many kinds of frying, but for the purpose of this discussion, frying
                shall refer to the act of deep frying, which involves immersing the food wholly in the oil/fat. Many foods are prepared using this technique,
                such as puris, vadas, pakodas, and other western dishes such as french fries, fried chicken etc.
