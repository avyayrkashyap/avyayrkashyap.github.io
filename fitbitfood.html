                            <p1>Through research and ideation with a focus on behaviour change, four features were designed to enhance user experience of Fitbit's food section. These were AI-based food recognition, Smart Cookies, Snapshot, and Story sharing. Usability testing demonstrated that the features significantly simplified the process of tracking food, improved end-of-day reflective tracking, and provided personalized statistics and recommendations for healthier food choices. Future improvements include enhancing the visibility of the Smart Cookies feature and strengthening its association with the reward system, implementing gamification aspects, and improving the snapshot feature's interface and layout.</p1>

                <p-h2>Primary Research</p-h2>
                <p1>An interview protocol was developed as a team and semistructured interviews were conducted with partcipants (n=5; age group: 23 - 35) who had various levels of expertise with using health tracking applications. We initially went in with an open mindset and recorded information about food and physical activity tracking. Using Affinity Mapping (see figure below), we realised that food tracking is a task users struggle with the most, and a large part of staying healthy involved being able to control their diet. Thus, we narrowed our focus down to diet improvement.</p1>

            <div class="container">
                <p1>While the affinity mapping helped us narrow down to designing a solution in diet improvement space, we still did not know what kind of improvements users would want to make in their diets. We needed a larger sample size to understand the core problem. So we decided to crowdsource problems. During a gallery walk session, we invited people nearby to help us with identifying problems by stating how they wished to improve their diet.</p1>

                <p1>In order to get existing users to regularly partake in the activity of logging their meals, we would need to design for behaviour change. We chose to use the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) because of the use of self efficacy to improve adherence. One of the main talking points from our research was users giving up on tracking because of the high cost of involvement. Since we knew we had to address this barrier, SCT was the forerunner.</p1>

                        <p1>The user can quickly log food using the camera. Through AI image recognition, the food is identified. If done correctly, the user can confirm this and log the food. Else, they can type the name of the food which can then be used to train the algorithm. The log contains both the image and the name in text.</p1>

                <p1>Smart cookies was an integral part to reinforcing outcome expectations, but did not meet expectations during usability testing. Taking a call on whether this is to be improved or canned will need greater research and is a decision we have yet to make.</p1>
                <p1>Social stories was seen as a good motivator, but did not fulfil some user needs such as being able to get the recipes for the foods shared. Explorations regarding incorporating said features need to be conducted.</p1>
