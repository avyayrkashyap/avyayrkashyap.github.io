                    This project was completed in partial fulfillment of credits for the Integrated Masters Program in Interaction Design at IDC School of Design, IIT Bombay. The duration of the project was from January 2020 to June 2020.

                        <p-h1>Why</p-h1>
                        <p1>Preparing a meal is a basic activity needed for survival. It involves complex steps that rely on multi-sensorial feedback, with significant emphasis placed on visual assessment to gauge progress. Reduced nutrition levels amongst Vision Impaired Persons (VIPs) due to the slim body of research, and therefore, product development allowing for independent meal preparation is what this project aims to tackle.
                        </p1>

                    <div>
                        <p-h1>What</p-h1>
                        <p1>Through multiple rounds of interviews with several VIPs, it was determined that roasting was the activity that would have maximum impact due to its importance in preparation of staples across the country, while also being one that VIPs were most likely to attempt in order to meet their nutrition needs. The solution proposed leverages existing behaviours and strategies, while mitigating many  pressing problems faced during the activity, and ensuring safety of the user, familiarity to surroundings and ease of use.

                    <div>
                        <p-h1>How</p-h1>
                        <p1>The ARKLid is designed to be used in conjunction with standard 28cm pans found in Indian households. The device is designed to aid in locating the centre of the pan by providing a reference point and timely feedback, while also mitigating the problems faced when needing to roast foods on both sides, as is required with preparations such as naan bread/roti.
                        </p1>

                <div>
                    <p-h1>Background</p-h1>
                    <p1>Preparing a meal is a basic activity needed for survival, involving multi-sensorial feedback, primarily relying on sight for many consequential decisions. Research has shown correlations between an individual’s ability to prepare a meal and quality of life [1], with lowered nutritions levels present among Visually Impaired Persons (VIPs) resulting from their lowered ability to shop for and prepare meals independently [2].</p1><br>

                    <p-h2>Assistive Devices</p-h2>
                    <p1>Assistive Devices (ADs) aid visually impaired persons by either augmenting senses or by enhancing sensory perception. There has been extensive work in aiding VIPs by enabling independence in various sectors such as navigation, personal care, financing, time keeping, and healthcare [3]. The body of research dealing with ADs for VIPs that aid in cooking related tasks is slim. Products present in the market predominantly take ergonomic considerations that help with mechanical tasks [5], and are designed primarily for a western audience and environment [1].<br /><br>

                    Recent advances in smart home care has led to widespread adoption of kitchen appliances with talk-back and automation. But these are rarely affordable by Indian households, and stand out in the tight and congested settings of Indian kitchens. Alternative solutions propose massive overhauls of societal infrastructure to enable independent movement and access, but is an expensive and resource intensive undertaking. Moreover, these solutions do not directly address the difficulties faced during the process of preparing meals, and instead seek to aid in the pre-meal preparations [6,7,8,9].<br /><br>
                        
                    The goal of this project was to understand and define the problems plaguing the vision impaired as they prepare a meal, and design an assistive device that enables independence in the kitchen while taking into consideration various aspects of safety, cost, and conformity with everyday objects and tasks</p1><br>

                    <p1>Primary research was conducted over two rounds of semi-structured interviews. The first round with 7 participants of differing levels of vision impairments was conducted to gauge the scope of the problem area. A second set of interviews honed in on understanding the specific problems mentioned, to scope the problem down further.</p1><br>

                    <p-h2>Insights</p-h2>
                    <p1>First round of interviews helped understand the problem area and differentiate between problems easily overcome with strategies when compared to problems that prevented VIPs from performing the activity.</p1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preparatory activities such as kneading, peeling, cutting, etc. do not rely solely on visual input and can be done with relative ease</li>
                        <li>Cognitive load is high while preparing meals and this forces VIPs to cook one dish at a time</li>
                        <li>Tasks involving the flame/heat are activities are the most dangerous ones to be performed when lacking sight</li>
                        <li>Family members would prefer if they did not perform activities which involve heat application, as there is possibility of causing multiple handicap</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p1>One of the participants said,</p1><br>
                    <p-quote>“Not everything requires eyes while cooking. A lot of it is understood by the feeling”</p-quote><br>
                    <p1>This helped scope the problem down to understanding problems faced when cooking on a flame.</p1><br>
                    <p1>Before conducting a second round of interviews, all the cooking techniques involving application of heat used to prepare Indian dishes were listed along with the meals that can be prepared using the said techniques. Four techniques identified that are commonly used to prepare staples in homes were Boiling, Simmering, Roasting, and Frying (4).</p1>
                    <img src="assets/projectImages/ARKLid/cookingTechniques.png" class="blogimage">
                    <p1>The second round of interviews were conducted with 5 participants of varying visual impairment levels and experience in kitchens to understand behaviours, problems and strategies used to prepare meals.</p1>

                    <p1>A SWOT analysis of the cooking techniques was performed.</p1><br>
                    <img src="assets/projectImages/ARKLid/SWOT.png" class="blogimage" ><br>
                    <p1>A necessity versus hesitancy graph was created to understand which of these cooking techniques could a potential intervention be designed for.</p1><br>
                    <img src="assets/projectImages/ARKLid/necessityvshesitancy.png" class="blogimage"><br>
                    <p1>The SWOT analysis and necessity vs hesitancy graph bring clarity to a few areas:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boiling and simmering are activities VIPs are comparitively more confortable attempting due to the lowered dependency of time based intervention when compared to roasting and frying.</li>
                            <li>The weaknesses VIPs face while Roasting and Frying also present a greater number of opportunities to design assistive devices to aid such scenarios, making these techniques more accessible.</li>
                            <li>The increased jeopardy when frying items coupled with inherent fear of the technique make frying a challenge to design and test for. Roasting, however, is a task VIPs are more likely to attempt, given the importance of the staples prepared using this method.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p1><br>
                    <p1>Hence, the problem statement was defined as:</p1><br>
                    <p-quote>How can I make the process of roasting foods in Indian kitchens accessible to Visually Impaired Persons?</p-quote><br>
                    <!--<p1>Boiling and simmering are fairly comparable, with low levels of hesitancy shown by VIPs in performing the activities. Roasting and frying on the other hand have a much greater necessity for potential designs to be explored given the graveness of the activity and the importance of the staples prepared using this method. The activity chosen for further design intervention was roasting due to greater willingness on the part of VIPs to attempt the cooking technique.</p1><br>-->
