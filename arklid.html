                    <h3>Why</h3>
                    <p-wwh>
                        Preparing a meal is basic activity needed for survival. It involved a range of sensory organs
                        to work with each other for a desirable outcome. Many decisions taken when preparing a meal are
                        heavily sight dependent. Ability to prepare a meal has direct implication on the quality of
                        life of the individual, with research indicating lowered nutrition levels among the vision
                        impaired, due to their lowered ability to shop for and prepare meals independently. Roasting,
                        being an activity that is used to prepare many staples of the Indian cuisine involves a large
                        amount of risk, but also has the potential to greatly impact and enable persons with vision
                        impairments to lead independent lives.

                <!--What-->
                <div>
                    <h3>What</h3>
                    <p-wwh>
                        The process of roasting foods was investigated. The process was broken down into multiple
                        subtasks, and those subtasks that were sight dependent were identified as problem areas and
                        solutions were brainstormed. The task of placing food on the heated pan, and flipping of the
                        food to roast the other side were two major tasks that were dangerous for vision impaired
                        persons to attempt. When potential solutions for the same got complicated, the process of
                        roasting was revisited. The task of roasting both sides by flipping the food back onto the
                        pan was eliminated and instead solutions to provide heat from both sides were brainstormed and
                        combined with solutions for placing food on the pan to create the final solution.
                    </p-wwh>
                </div>

                <!--How-->
                <div>
                    <h3>How</h3>
                    <p-wwh>
                        ARKLid was designed to aid with the process of roasting foods, with the bottom of the
                        food heated from an existing cook-top and the top of the food heated with the thermoelectric
                        generators passing heat through a hot-plate. The lid is designed to work with a standard 28cm
                        diameter pan, by clamping on to the handle. The lid’s handle has tactile DC Vibration motors
                        that provide haptic feedback to aid in recognising the centre of the pan and in letting the
                        user know of the heating status. The heat supplied is controlled by a sliding potentiometer
                        placed next to the handle, with tactile and haptic cues informing the user about the amount
                        of heat being supplied via the hotplate. When the lid is not being used for roasting foods,
                        a pair of ultrasonic sensors let the user navigate to the centre of the pan with the motor’s
                        vibrational intensity varying to help guide the user.
